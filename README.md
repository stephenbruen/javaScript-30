# javaScript-30
working on Wes Bos Javascript 30 class which can be found here https://javascript30.com/ (*free by the way)
It's main role is to work on vanilla Javascript and create min projects to really learn the language. I started it on 12/30
<br>
Day 1 is in it's own repo
<br>
Day 2 was a javascript clock done on 12/30/2019
<br>
Day 3 was working on javaScript variables done on 12/31 and was working on scoped css variables and js 
<br>
day 4 working on using arrays and going into that more than building something. I went over .map, .filter, arrow functions, .sort
<br>
day 5 Actually made a project today. Used flexbox for this project which I haven't used yet so that was new. Had a few errors but It turned out fine once I figured them out. 
<br>
day 6 Worked with Ajax and api. This went over a few things I've never heard of (like regex) so will have to do some research to learn some more about all of this.
<br>
day 7 worked on more array work and es6 arrow functions. Nothing built just like day 4 looks like the next thing will be more of a project.
<br>
day 8 maded a html canvas where you can paint differnet colors. Kinda like ms paint minus a few things(maybe i can add to that). Worked on this the same day as day 7 since it was so short!
<br>
day 9 Wes taught us some dev tricks, I've only ever used console.log and console.table. So he went over some tricks that you may use. A couple of them were de-bugging tips which I've used since learning since I'm having trouble with one of my projects.

day 12 skipped ahead since I had a little bit of time to work on this so I picked a smaller project. The cornify thing was intresting that was a feature in javascript for some reason. mainly went over key detection.
